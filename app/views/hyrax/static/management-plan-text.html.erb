<p>The data generated through this project will be deposited into Deep Blue Data, the University of Michigan's institutional data repository. Deep Blue Data has been developed by the U-M Library to assist researchers in complying with grant-funding agency requirements.</p>

<p>Content in Deep Blue Data is stored on networked storage operated by U-M Information and Technology Services (ITS) in campus data centers. ITS provides the Library with a single active instance of the content on spinning disk and a nightly replica of the content to an alternate campus datacenter for disaster recovery purposes only. Tape backups with 6-month retention are conducted nightly using the campus-operated tape backup service and are also replicated to a remote site nightly. More details about the storage service are available at <a href=http://services.it.umich.edu/mistorage>MiStorage</a> and about the tape backup service at <a href=http://services.it.umich.edu/mibackup>MiBackup</a></p>

<p>During deposit, researchers include documentation for the data and assign metadata to the data to facilitate its discovery and use. The metadata can be harvested by search engines such as Google Scholar. Data sets are assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) as a persistent identifier for the data, enabling the data to be cited in publications. Researchers select a Creative Commons license as a part of the deposit process to describe the conditions under which others may use the data. Deposited data will be accessible through the Deep Blue Data for at least 10 years, after which it will be appraised for continued preservation by University Library personnel.</p>
