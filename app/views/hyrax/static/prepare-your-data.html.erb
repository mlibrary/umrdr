<h2>Prepare Your Data</h2>

<h3 id="data-format-and-deposit-size">Data Format &amp; Deposit Size</h3>

<p>Deep Blue Data will accept any file format. We will accept compressed data (.zip, .gz, tar.gz) although to facilitate basic preservation services compressed data is discouraged. <a href="file-format-preservation">Review file formats and levels of preservation</a>.</p>

<p>We do not foresee placing cumulative storage limits on deposits, but there are some constraints on the size of deposits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The maximum size of a deposit uploaded through the online interface is <strong>2 GB</strong>.</li>
  <li>For deposits exceeding <strong>2 GB</strong>, we will work with depositors to ingest your data. <a href="<%= hyrax.contact_path %>">Please contact us if your deposit exceeds 2 GB</a>.</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id="license">License</h3>

<p>Depositors will be asked  to apply one of several <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses to the data. Depositors authorize the Library to distribute the data under the terms of the license they have selected.</p>


<h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3>

<p>We require descriptive metadata for each deposited dataset. A detailed description of the data's origins, purpose, and use are essential for both discoverability and reuse. The following are our minimum requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Title:</strong> a descriptive title for the data and any associated works you deposit along with it</li>
  <li><strong>Authors(s):</strong> those involved in creating the data. Enter last name then first name then middle initial. (Ex. Smith, Jane M.)</li>
  <li><strong>Date Coverage:</strong> The specific date (ex. mm/dd/yyyy) or span of time (ex. mm/dd/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy - mm/dd/yyyy) the data set was collected, or relates to, as determined by its author(s).</li>
  <li><strong>Method:</strong> a description of how the data set was generated, acquired and/or processed (this should include any software, instrumentation or equipment used.)</li>
  <li><strong>Description:</strong> a brief description of the datafiles, what they contain and any accompanying documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The system also generates metadata automatically to help us maintain the integrity of your files and provide a complete record:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timestamp:</strong> Deep Blue Data captures the time and date of your deposit and generates a timestamp when any changes to deposits are made to track modifications over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Depositor:</strong> who made the deposit and any subsequent changes, in case we need to consult with them about issues that arise</li>
  <li><strong>Checksums:</strong> an error detection mechanism to help ensure the integrity of the files</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of which license a depositor chooses for data distribution, metadata will always be distributed with the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0 license</a> in order to facilitate the broadest possible use.</p>
