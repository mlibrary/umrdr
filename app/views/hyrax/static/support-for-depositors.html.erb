<h2>Support for Depositors</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/research-data-services">Research Data Services</a> and other members of the U-M Library provide a suite of services to assist you in preparing your data for deposit into Deep Blue Data.</p>

<h3 id="dataplan">Data Management Plan</h3>
The <a href="management-plan-text">text for DMP</a> can be inserted into your data management plan to indicate your use of Deep Blue Data as a means to share and preserve your data.

<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<p>Librarians will review and provide feedback on your data management plan, which is now required by many funding agencies. More generally, we will consult with you to help you plan for the eventual deposit of your data into Deep Blue Data and consider what actions you might need to take over the course of your research. We can also help you discover other data sets that are relevant to your research for your use or to serve as examples for developing your own data set.</p>

<h3 id="managing">Managing</h3>
<p>Librarians are available for consultation about managing and developing your data set so that it can be shared and preserved when the time comes. We can work with you to help you consider what documentation you will need, how you might describe your data using a metadata schema that is appropriate for your data, and how to organize your data to make it easier to understand and use.</p>

<h3 id="depositing">Depositing</h3>
<p>When you are ready to deposit your data into Deep Blue Data, we can help you gather what information you will need, walk you through the process, or answer any questions that you may have. We can also provide guidance on how to increase the potential impact of sharing your data set through Deep Blue Data.</p>
